The alpha meshing algorithm only needs one parameter which is called alpha. Alpha determines the largest size an edge between to points can be. If alpha is to small then some points that should be connected won't be, which leads to holes in the mesh. If alpha is to large then points that shouldn't be connected will be, which removes detail from the scan. We would that the best compromise is an alpha of 0.2.\n",

As described here [https://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs268-11-spring/handouts/AlphaShapes/as_fisher.pdf] one can intuitively think of an alpha shape as the following: Imagine a huge mass of ice cream containing the points S as hard chocolate pieces. Using one of these sphere-formed ice cream spoons we carve out all parts of the ice cream block we can reach without bumping into chocolate pieces, thereby even carving out holes in the inside (e.g., parts not reachable by simply moving the spoon from the outside). We will eventually end up with a (not necessarily convex) object bounded by caps, arcs and points. If we now straighten all round faces to triangles and line segments, we have an intuitive description of what is called the alpha shape of S."
