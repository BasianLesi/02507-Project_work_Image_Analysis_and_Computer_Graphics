## Getting started
Access as any jupyter notebook. 
There are 6 notebooks numbered, while the others are functions-holders and called when needed.

## Generated Files
The first time you run 1-Introduction_data_overview, some .txt directory files will be created in order to find data and notebooks folders.
Note also that there are a lot of temporary files that can be created while handling the visualizations (just by pressing keys such as P or O).

## Core Functions
Core functions for the stitching process are under "Stitching_clean" and are commented (almost) line by line.
